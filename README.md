# 📊 Tableau Learning Dashboards

This repository contains three interactive dashboards created during my self‑paced Tableau learning journey. The goal of these projects was to enhance my skills in data visualization, storytelling, and dashboard design by working with different datasets and exploring Tableau’s wide range of features.

## 🎯 Purpose
The primary objective was to strengthen proficiency in Tableau Desktop Public Edition through hands‑on practice. Each dashboard demonstrates the application of filters, calculated fields, parameters, and layout techniques to build clear, insightful, and interactive visualizations. By working independently, I focused on learning how to transform raw data into meaningful stories that highlight trends, comparisons, and patterns.

## 📁 Datasets
Three distinct datasets were used:
- **Sales Data**: Regional and segment‑wise breakdown of sales and profit  
- **Transaction Data**: Digital payment activity across age groups, merchants, and cities  
- **Student Survey Data**: Metrics on sleep duration, study hours, satisfaction, academic pressure, and financial stress  

These datasets provided variety and allowed me to practice building dashboards across business, financial, and social domains.

## 📈 Dashboards
### 1. Sales & Profit Dashboard

### 3. Student Metrics Dashboard
